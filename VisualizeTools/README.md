These Jupyter Notebooks are designed to visualize fragility and vulnerability curves.

### Usage
- You can try the notebooks directly in a Binder environment:

**or:**
- place the .csv file in the same directory and update its name within the notebook.
- To visualize the statistics of the fragility curves, you’ll need to specify in the notebook the fragility curve corresponding to the desired damage level. 

_An example .csv file has been provided in the notebook directory_

## Requirements
